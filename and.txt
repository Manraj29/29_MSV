The AND gate is a basic digital logic gate that implements logicalconjunction - it behaves according to the truth table to the right. A HIGH output (1) results only if all the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH (1). If none or not all inputs  to the AND gate are HIGH, LOW output results. The function can be extended to   any number of inputs.
